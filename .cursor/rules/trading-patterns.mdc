# Trading Patterns and Signal Format

## Pattern File Format
Pattern files should follow this structure:
```
===== Action Plan =====
Entry: HH:MM AM/PM CT
Exit: HH:MM AM/PM CT
Direction: Buy ðŸ“ˆ or Sell ðŸ“‰
TP: XX.XX points
SL: XX.XX points
Success Rate: XX.XX%
------------------------------
```

## Pattern Types
The bot supports different pattern types defined in [pattern_database.json](mdc:pattern_database.json):
- Moderate patterns (default)
- Aggressive patterns
- Conservative patterns

## Signal Processing
1. Signals are processed sequentially based on entry time
2. Each signal must include:
   - Entry time (Central Time)
   - Exit time (Central Time)
   - Trade direction
   - Take profit level
   - Stop loss level
   - Historical success rate

## Position Management Rules
1. Only one position can be active at a time
2. New positions are only opened after previous position is closed
3. Positions are closed when:
   - Take profit is hit
   - Stop loss is hit
   - Exit time is reached
   - Manual intervention is required

## Risk Management
- Each trade has predefined take profit and stop loss levels
- Success rate is tracked for each pattern type
- Trades are executed using paper trading first
- Position size is controlled by TRADE_QTY parameter
