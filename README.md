# SPX Pattern Automated Trading Bot

This bot automatically executes trades for SPX based on pattern signals using Alpaca's paper trading API.

## Features

- Automatically executes trades based on pattern signals from pattern files
- Maintains only one position at a time to prevent conflicting trades
- Monitors positions for take profit, stop loss, and time-based exits
- Logs trade details to a CSV file for record keeping
- Processes signals sequentially based on entry time

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Alpaca Paper Trading account

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install python-dotenv alpaca-trade-api pandas pytz
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Alpaca API credentials:
   ```
   APCA_API_KEY_ID=your_api_key_here
   APCA_API_SECRET_KEY=your_api_secret_here
   APCA_API_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a pattern file in the format `moderate_patterns_YYYYMMDD.txt` in the root directory.
2. Run the bot:
   ```
   python src/simulator/main.py
   ```
3. The bot will:
   - Parse the most recent pattern file
   - Sort signals by entry time
   - Execute trades sequentially (one position at a time)
   - Monitor positions and exit based on TP/SL or exit time
   - Log all trades to `logs/trade_log.csv`

## Pattern File Format

The bot expects pattern files in the following format:

```
===== Action Plan =====

Exit: 12:30PM CT
Direction: Sell ðŸ“‰
TP: 26.54 points
SL: 16.59 points

## Configuration

You can modify the following constants in `src/simulator/main.py`:

- `SYMBOL`: The symbol to trade (default: "SPY")
- `TRADE_QTY`: Number of contracts to trade (default: 1)
- `CHECK_INTERVAL`: Time in seconds between price checks (default: 5)

## Position Management

The bot implements position management to ensure only one position is active at a time:

- Before placing an order, the bot checks if there's already an active position
- Trades are processed sequentially in order of entry time
- If an existing position is found at startup, it will be closed before starting new trades
- Thread-safe locks prevent race conditions when checking/updating position status

## Logs

All trades are logged to `logs/trade_log.csv` with the following information:

- Date
- Entry time
- Exit time
- Direction (BUY/SELL)
- Entry price
- Exit price
- Take profit points
- Stop loss points
- Exit reason (TP/SL/TIME)
- PnL
